# Fashion MNIST Image Classification

This project is a simple **image classification model** built on the [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist), implemented using **TensorFlow/Keras**.  

It was developed as a **practice project** to explore neural networks and gain hands-on experience with training, evaluation, and visualization of deep learning models.

## Project Overview

- Dataset: Fashion MNIST (60,000 training images, 10,000 test images, 10 classes)
- Model: Fully Connected Neural Network (Dense layers)
- Input: 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items
- Output: One of 10 fashion categories  
  (`T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot`)
